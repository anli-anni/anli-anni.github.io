<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am an Assistant Professor at UNC-Charlotte. I received a PhD degree at the Control and Optimization of Discrete Event Systems (CODES) Laboratory of Boston University advised by Prof. Christos G. Cassandras, and I got my Master degree at Applied Mathematics in 2020 from Tongji University. My research interests are control theory, optimization, and machine learning with applications to mutli-agent systems, e.g., connected automated vehicles.

<font color="red">I am actively looking for PhD students working in control theory and its applications in multi-agent systems. </font>
